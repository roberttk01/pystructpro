## New Python Project Structural Organizer


Used to generate and organize the directories of a simple Python application at the beginning of a project for the user. The organization is based on Matt Bachmann's 2016 talk at the Boston Python User Group. The Youtube video of the lecture may be found [here](https://youtu.be/RKHMnevITF0) and the slide may be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/bachmann1234/structuring-your-python-project).
